## About the project

This is reactJS introductory project in which we are going to make a TodoList. It helps in understanding the working and structure of reactJS applications. It is beginer application which uses basic functionalities like adding item in todolist, marking todo item, deleting todo item. For fetching todo list item here I am using [jsonplaceholder api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
Used react-router for routing to different pages and axios for api requests.
